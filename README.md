# Student Stress Detection Model

This project focuses on predicting student stress levels based on behavioral and academic data. The model aims to detect stress patterns using machine learning techniques and provides insights into potential stress factors that affect students.

## Project Overview

The **Student Stress Detection Model** analyzes various student data, such as academic performance, behavioral patterns, and other relevant features, to predict whether a student is experiencing stress. This project demonstrates the application of **machine learning** and **data analysis** in a real-world scenario to improve student well-being.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of student-related data (e.g., study habits, sleep patterns, academic performance, etc.) collected from a survey. Key features include:

- **Study Hours**
- **Sleep Duration**
- **Grades**
- **Social Media Usage**
- **Physical Activity**

## Model Development

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data cleaning (handling missing values, removing duplicates).
   - Feature engineering (scaling numerical data, encoding categorical variables).
   
2. **Model Training**:
   - We used a **classification algorithm** (e.g., **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Random Forest**, etc.) to predict whether a student is stressed.
   
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
   
4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizing relationships between features and stress levels, providing insights into potential causes of student stress.
